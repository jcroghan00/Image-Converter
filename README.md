# Image-Converter
A simple image converter built off of ffmpeg with the possibility of adding other data types in the future.

This project mostly exists because I wanted an excuse to work with UI elements in python, also because my dad was complaining about his phone saving stuff as 'heic' as opposed to 'jpg'. Love you dad <3

Make sure that ffmpeg is installed and available on the PATH. If you need help I thought this article was helpful for Windows: [Installing FFmpeg on Windows]:(https://phoenixnap.com/kb/ffmpeg-windows)

I have not tested this on other operating systems, so it may not function at all.
