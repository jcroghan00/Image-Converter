# Image-Converter
A simple image converter built off of ffmpeg with the possibility of adding other data types in the future.

This project mostly exists because I wanted an excuse to work with UI elements in python, also because my dad was complaining about his phone saving stuff as 'heic' as opposed to 'jpg'. Love you dad <3
